# 3SEB

## Synopsis

This project contains experimental *Python* code for the *Three Source Energy Balance*  (3SEB) model using a nested double Priestley-Taylor intialization (**ThreeSEB_PT**) for estimating sensible and latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) based on measurements of radiometric surface temperature over tree-grass ecosystems. 

3SEB is a modified version of Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model (Norman et al. 1995). It incorporates an additional vegetation source within its model structure (i.e., overstory vegetation, understory vegetation and soil). It largely uses and is based on functions developed from the python implementation of TSEB (pyTSEB, which can be found here: https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB/).

This repository contains a high-level script (**Main_run3SEB_ground.py**) to run 3SEB with the example datasets provided in **Inputs** using data from:

AU-Dry (Obtained from Ozflux portal: https://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/dryriver/)

ES-LM1 (Obtained from Zenodo public repository: https://zenodo.org/record/4453567#.YWMEDNpByyw)

ES-Abr (Obtained from Zenodo public repository: https://zenodo.org/record/3707842#.YWMEAtpByyz)

US-Ton (Obtained from Ameriflux portal: https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Ton)


The script **Functions_3SEB.py** provides the core functions necessary to run 3SEB.


## Installation
The following Python libraries will be required:
- pyTSEB: https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB/
- Numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib


With `conda`, you can create a complete environment with
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

or with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can install py3SEB as:
```bash
pip install ./
```

## Basic Contents
### High-level scripts
- *Main_run3SEB_ground.py*  high level scripts for running **ThreeSEB_PT** with the example inputs

### Low-level module
The low-level module in this project is aimed at providing customisation and more flexibility in running 3SEB. 
The following module is included:

- *./py3seb/pyseb.py*
> core functions for running different 3SEB models (`ThreeSEB_PT(*args,**kwargs)`). 

## Tests
The folders *.Inputs/Meteo_data* and *.Inputs/Veg_data* contains the example for running 3SEB. Just run the high-level scripts *Main_run3SEB_ground.py* and see the resulting outputs stored in *./Output/*
